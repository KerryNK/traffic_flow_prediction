Using Machine Learning to Redesign Public Transport for Sustainable Cities (SDG 11)
Introduction
Cities worldwide are rapidly growing, placing immense pressure on urban infrastructure, especially public transport systems. Efficient, accessible, and sustainable public transport is critical to reducing congestion, lowering emissions, and improving quality of life. This project leverages machine learning to optimize public transport routes, directly supporting SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.

What is SDG 11?
SDG 11 aims to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by ensuring access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems for all. Achieving this goal helps reduce urban pollution, traffic accidents, and social inequalities, fostering healthier and more equitable urban environments.

Why Public Transport Matters
Public transport reduces reliance on private vehicles, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion. It also provides mobility to vulnerable populations who may lack access to private cars, thus promoting social inclusion and economic opportunity.

The Problem
Many cities suffer from inefficient and fragmented public transport routes, leading to longer travel times, overcrowding, and increased emissions. These inefficiencies contribute to urban air pollution and limit accessibility for underserved communities, undermining sustainability and equity goals.

Your Solution
This project applies unsupervised machine learning, specifically clustering algorithms (K-means), to analyze spatial data on bus stops, ridership patterns, and urban geography. By grouping stops and demand centers into optimized clusters, the algorithm identifies logical route hubs and service zones, enabling:

Reduction of redundant or overlapping routes

Improved coverage of underserved areas

Shorter and more direct routes

Tools Used
Python for data processing and model development

Scikit-learn for implementing clustering algorithms

Open-source datasets including GTFS public transport data and city spatial information

Results
The clustering model generated visual maps showing optimized public transport clusters. Key improvements include:

Increased coverage of high-demand and previously underserved areas

Reduction in average route length, potentially lowering emissions

Enhanced accessibility with stops positioned within convenient walking distances

These results demonstrate the potential for significant emission reductions and improved commuter experience.

Ethical Reflection
The project carefully addresses ethical considerations by:

Using anonymized, aggregated data to protect privacy

Ensuring data represents diverse urban populations to avoid bias

Prioritizing accessibility for vulnerable groups including the elderly and disabled

Promoting sustainability by focusing on emission reductions and equitable service

Transparency in model design and results visualization supports stakeholder trust and community engagement.

Conclusion
By applying machine learning clustering techniques, this project offers a data-driven approach to redesigning public transport routes that align with SDG 11â€™s vision of sustainable, inclusive cities. Future enhancements could include integrating real-time transit and traffic data for dynamic route optimization and deploying the model as an interactive web app for urban planners.

Together, AI and sustainable development can transform urban mobility for a cleaner, fairer future.
