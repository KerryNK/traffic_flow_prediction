# traffic_flow_prediction

1. Problem Definition
SDG Goal: Sustainable Cities and Communities
Problem: Urban traffic congestion leads to pollution, delays, and decreased quality of life.
Solution: Use supervised machine learning to predict traffic volume using historical data (e.g., weather, time, date, holidays), enabling better planning of traffic systems.

2. Machine Learning Approach
Approach: Supervised Learning
Model Options:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Random Forest Regressor (better accuracy)

Neural Network (optional advanced version)

3. Dataset & Tools
Dataset: Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset on Kaggle
Features Include:

Date/time

Weather (temperature, rain, snow, clouds)

Holiday

Traffic volume (target)

Tools:

Google Colab (cloud coding)

Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, tensorflow (optional)

4. Model Pipeline (Code Overview)
Hereâ€™s a simplified Google Colab notebook template:

Step 1: Setup & Upload
python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv')
df = df.dropna()
df['date_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_time'])
df['hour'] = df['date_time'].dt.hour
df['day'] = df['date_time'].dt.dayofweek
Step 3: Features and Target
python
Copy
Edit
features = df[['temp', 'rain_1h', 'snow_1h', 'clouds_all', 'hour', 'day']]
target = df['traffic_volume']
Step 4: Model Training
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, preds))
Step 5: Visualization
python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(y_test.values[:100], label="Actual")
plt.plot(preds[:100], label="Predicted")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Traffic Volume Prediction")
plt.show()
ðŸ¤– 5. Ethical Reflection
Bias: Ensure diverse traffic data across seasons and times.

Privacy: No personal data is used.

Fairness: Supports better transport infrastructure and reduces pollution.
